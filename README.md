# SubtitleTranslator

Little commandline Subtitle translator. Uses LibreTranslate as a front end.

Uses translate.json to configure translation.

Should be straightforward, specify the srt file, source language & languages you want to translate (can also include "en"). The LibreTranslate Url is an instance of LibreTranslate which *does not* have API key - this is deliberate as a subtitle file will cause millions of requests. 

`docker run -ti --rm -p 5000:5000 libretranslate/libretranslate:v1.3.8`

When it runs the app will use the outpout path to store .tmp files. These are valid SRT files but as LibreTranslate can be a little glitchy it protectsa against this by making translations reentrant. Every 100 translations causes the tmp file to be recreated; when complete this file is 'moved' tom the final srt.  

On load these tmp files are used to pre-load translated items.
